# Builtin Tool Enhancements Plan

## Overview

This plan addresses GitHub Issue #29: "Enhance builtin tools for better file editing experience". The goal is to improve the developer experience when using builtin tools for file operations by splitting confusing functionality, adding formatting options, and providing better error messages.

## Problem Statement

Current builtin tools have several pain points identified through developer feedback:

- `builtin-read` returns files as single-line strings, making output hard to read
- `builtin-search-replace` combines search and replace in one tool with inconsistent argument naming (`file` vs `path`)
- Regex errors lack helpful context about what failed
- Multiline content is difficult to pass to tools
- No dry-run capability to preview changes
- No granular line/range operations, requiring complex regex workarounds

## Goals

1. Improve readability of file content output
2. Separate search and replace concerns into distinct tools
3. Provide actionable error messages for regex failures
4. Support multiline content more naturally
5. Enable safe preview of replacements before execution
6. Simplify targeted edits with line-level operations
7. Ensure comprehensive documentation for all new and modified tools

## Non-Goals

- Changing the core functionality of existing tools beyond the specified enhancements
- Replacing existing tools with entirely new abstractions
- Adding completely unrelated features not mentioned in the issue
- Deprecation strategy (not used in this project)
- Backwards compatibility concerns (internal project, no external users yet)
- Migration guides or breaking change documentation

## Implementation Phases

This plan is broken into 7 independent phases, each addressing one enhancement. Each phase can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

### Phase 1: Formatted Output for `builtin-read`

**Focus:** Improve file content display

**Tasks:**

- Add `--lines` flag to split output by line
- Add `--line-numbers` flag for numbered output
- Consider defaulting to line-split for better UX

**Files to Touch:**

- `packages/shoggoth/src/tools/builtin-read.ts`

**Testing:**

- Test with various file sizes and content types
- Verify line-splitting handles edge cases (empty lines, special characters)

### Phase 2: Split `builtin-search-replace`

**Focus:** Separate concerns and normalize APIs

**Approach:**

- Create new `builtin-search` tool for search-only functionality
- Modify `builtin-search-replace` to keep only replace functionality
- Rename `file` parameter to `path` across both tools for consistency

**Files to Touch:**

- `packages/shoggoth/src/tools/builtin-search.ts` (new)
- `packages/shoggoth/src/tools/builtin-search-replace.ts` (modify to keep replace only)
- `packages/shoggoth/src/tools/index.ts` (update registration)
- Documentation files

**Testing:**

- Verify search functionality in new tool
- Verify replace functionality retained in modified tool
- Ensure API consistency between both tools
- Verify `path` parameter works correctly

### Phase 3: Improved Regex Error Messages

**Focus:** Better developer feedback on parsing failures

**Tasks:**

- Catch regex compilation errors in both search and replace tools
- Extract position and context from error messages
- Format user-friendly error output showing the problematic pattern
- Provide actionable suggestions for fixing common errors

**Files to Touch:**

- `packages/shoggoth/src/tools/builtin-search.ts`
- `packages/shoggoth/src/tools/builtin-search-replace.ts`

**Testing:**

- Test with various invalid regex patterns
- Verify error messages are actionable and clear

### Phase 4: Multiline String Support in `builtin-exec`

**Focus:** Easier handling of multiline content

**Tasks:**

- Document or implement JSON array syntax for multiline argv
- Optionally add `--multiline` flag for raw multiline strings
- Consider automatic detection of multiline content
- Provide clear examples for common use cases (commit messages, scripts)

**Files to Touch:**

- `packages/shoggoth/src/tools/builtin-exec.ts`
- Documentation

**Testing:**

- Test with commit messages, scripts, and other multiline content
- Verify proper escaping and delimiting

### Phase 5: Dry-Run Mode for Replacements

**Focus:** Safe preview of changes

**Tasks:**

- Add `--dry-run` or `--preview` flag to `builtin-search-replace`
- Output proposed changes without modifying files
- Include line numbers and context around replacements
- Distinguish between "would match" and "would replace"
- Add safety limits (e.g., warn on >1000 matches)

**Files to Touch:**

- `packages/shoggoth/src/tools/builtin-search-replace.ts`

**Testing:**

- Verify no file modifications in dry-run mode
- Check output includes clear preview of changes
- Test with various regex patterns
- Verify safety limits work correctly

### Phase 6: Line-Level Operations

**Focus:** Simplify targeted edits

**Tasks:**

- Add line deletion functionality to `builtin-search-replace` (e.g., `deleteLines` array or `deleteRange`)
- Add range-based replacement option (`replaceRange`)
- Consider adding line range support to `builtin-write`
- Ensure line numbers are 1-indexed and clearly documented
- Handle edge cases (out-of-range, overlapping, entire file deletion)

**Files to Touch:**

- `packages/shoggoth/src/tools/builtin-search-replace.ts` (new options)
- `packages/shoggoth/src/tools/builtin-write.ts` (optional range support)
- Documentation

**Testing:**

- Test line deletion on various files
- Test range replacements at boundaries
- Verify error handling for out-of-range operations
- Test edge cases comprehensively

### Phase 7: Documentation Updates

**Focus:** Comprehensive documentation for all new and modified tools

**Tasks:**

- Update `docs/tools/builtin-read.md` with new flags, output formats, and edge cases
- Create `docs/tools/builtin-search.md` with full feature documentation and examples
- Update `docs/tools/builtin-search-replace.md` with new parameter names and features
- Create `docs/tools/builtin-replace.md` documenting the renamed functionality
- Update `docs/tools/builtin-exec.md` with multiline string usage examples
- Add documentation for dry-run mode behavior and safety features
- Document line-level operation syntax, constraints, and examples
- Update API reference with all new parameters and default values
- Add usage examples for each new feature
- Document all error message formats with examples
- Include troubleshooting section for common issues

**Files to Modify/Create:**

- `docs/tools/builtin-read.md` (update)
- `docs/tools/builtin-search.md` (new)
- `docs/tools/builtin-search-replace.md` (update)
- `docs/tools/builtin-replace.md` (new)
- `docs/tools/builtin-exec.md` (update)
- `docs/tools/README.md` (update tool listing)

**Testing:**

- Verify all documentation builds correctly
- Check code examples work as documented
- Ensure all tool signatures match actual implementation
- Peer review for clarity and completeness

## Success Criteria

- Each phase completes with all tests passing
- All enhancement goals are met
- Comprehensive documentation (Phase 7) completed
- Negative testing confirms robust error handling
- All examples are copy-paste ready and work as documented

## Risk Assessment

| Performance regression with large files | Low        | Medium | Add streaming or chunked processing if needed          |
| Multiline string escaping issues        | Medium     | Low    | Thorough testing with various delimiters               |
| Documentation gaps or confusion         | Medium     | Low    | Peer review of docs, testing examples with first users |

## Dependencies

- None (self-contained improvements)
- Testing dependencies already in place
- No external API changes required

## Timeline

Target completion: 2.5 weeks (documentation adds half week)

- Week 1: Phases 1-3 (output formatting, API consistency, error handling)
- Week 2: Phases 4-6 (multiline support, dry-run, line operations)
- Week 2.5: Phase 7 (comprehensive documentation)

## Related Issues

- GitHub Issue #29 (source)

## Open Questions

1. Should line-splitting be the default for `builtin-read`, or remain opt-in?
2. Should line deletion be a separate tool or an option of `builtin-search-replace`?
3. What's the best API for specifying line ranges (inclusive/exclusive, 0-indexed vs 1-indexed)?

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of Phase 1
2. Add tests for each feature before implementation
3. Create PRs for each phase or group related phases together
4. Start Phase 7 documentation work after Phase 2a (search tool created)
5. Gather feedback on intermediate deliverables
