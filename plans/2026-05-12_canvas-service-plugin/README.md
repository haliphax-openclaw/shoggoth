# Canvas Web Server — Shoggoth Service Plugin Port

## Summary

Port the [OpenClaw Canvas web server](https://github.com/haliphax-ai/openclaw-canvas-web) to Shoggoth's plugin and service registry system. The Canvas server becomes a `service`-kind plugin (`@shoggoth/service-canvas`) that registers its HTTP/WebSocket endpoints through the `ServiceGateway` and exposes canvas manipulation commands as direct in-process tools. All `openclaw` package scopes are renamed to `shoggoth`, URL schemes are renamed to `shoggoth://` equivalents, environment variables are replaced by Shoggoth config and defaults, OpenClaw-specific components (node client, MCP server) are removed, and documentation is fully ported.

## Motivation

The Canvas web server is a cross-platform canvas that agents control via WebSocket. It renders HTML content and A2UI (Agent-to-UI) surfaces in a Vue 3 SPA. Currently built for OpenClaw, it uses:

- **NodeClient** — Ed25519-authenticated gateway node registration to receive `node.invoke` commands
- **HTTP proxy routes** (`/api/agent`, `/api/file-spawn`) — intermediaries that let the browser spawn subagents/prompt sessions by proxying to the gateway's `/tools/invoke` using a gateway token
- **Environment variables** — `OPENCLAW_CANVAS_*` for all configuration
- **MCP server** — separate process exposing canvas commands via MCP
- **`openclaw://` URL schemes** — deep links and canvas-cross-session references

In Shoggoth:

- NodeClient is replaced by the plugin system's `service.register` hook
- Configuration comes from `ctx.config.services?.canvas` with built-in defaults — no environment variables
- Proxy routes stay but call Shoggoth's internal session spawn directly using the plugin's trusted in-process identity — no gateway token needed
- URL schemes are renamed to `shoggoth://`, `shoggoth-fileprompt://`, `shoggoth-canvas://`
- The MCP server is removed because tools are natively exposed to agents

## Design

### Architecture

```
Shoggoth Agent ──tool call──▶ DirectServiceTool handler ──▶ Gateway (in-memory)
                                                              │
Browser ──click A2UI element──▶ SPA ──POST /api/agent──▶ plugin route
                                   │                        │
                                   └──POST /api/file───┐   │
                                                        ▼   ▼
                                              Shoggoth session spawn (in-process)
                                              via plugin trusted identity
```

The plugin starts its own Express + WebSocket server on a configured port. Agent tool calls bypass HTTP entirely — they invoke the same in-memory `Gateway` object directly. Browser-initiated spawns go through the Express routes, which call Shoggoth's internal session spawn in-process using the plugin's trusted identity (no external HTTP proxy, no token).

### Package Renaming

All `openclaw`-prefixed scopes become `shoggoth`:

| Old                                        | New                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `@haliphax-openclaw/a2ui-sdk`              | `@shoggoth/a2ui-sdk`                |
| `@haliphax-openclaw/a2ui-catalog-basic`    | `@shoggoth/a2ui-catalog-basic`      |
| `@haliphax-openclaw/a2ui-catalog-extended` | `@shoggoth/a2ui-catalog-extended`   |
| `@haliphax-openclaw/a2ui-catalog-all`      | `@shoggoth/a2ui-catalog-all`        |
| `openclaw-canvas-web` (project)            | `@shoggoth/service-canvas` (plugin) |

### URL Scheme Renaming

All `openclaw://`-prefixed URL schemes become `shoggoth://`:

| Old scheme                           | New scheme                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `openclaw://agent?message=...`       | `shoggoth://agent?message=...`       |
| `openclaw-fileprompt://<path>`       | `shoggoth-fileprompt://<path>`       |
| `openclaw-canvas://<session>/<path>` | `shoggoth-canvas://<session>/<path>` |

| `file-spawn` route                                   | **Adapt** | Operator-initiated prompt file spawn from browser clicks. Same adaptation as agent-proxy                                                                                                  |

| Auth mechanism                                       | **Adapt** | No gateway token. Plugin uses its own trusted in-process identity as a Shoggoth plugin                                                                                                    |

### Configuration

All configuration comes from the Shoggoth config system. No environment variables are read.

```json
{
  "plugins": [{ "package": "@shoggoth/service-canvas" }],
  "services": {
    "canvas": {
      "port": 3456,
      "host": "0.0.0.0",
      "basePath": "/",
      "skipConfirm": false,
      "a2uiDbPath": "~/.shoggoth/canvas/a2ui-cache.db",
      "ignoreDirs": ["tmp", "jsonl"],
      "agentWorkspaces": {}
    }
  }
}
```

All fields are omitted — sensible defaults are applied for any omitted field.

### Auth: Trusted Identity

The plugin does not need an external gateway token or any credential stored in environment variables. As a Shoggoth plugin, it runs **in-process** as a trusted extension of the daemon. The daemon already trusts plugin-registered code — there is no separate authentication boundary between the plugin and the session spawn mechanism.

### Proxy Route Adaptation

Both proxy routes (`/api/agent` and `/api/file-spawn`) let the **operator** (via the browser) spawn subagents or prompt existing sessions by clicking A2UI elements in the canvas. The browser can't call Shoggoth's session tools directly, so the canvas server acts as a trusted intermediary.

- **OpenClaw:** routes HTTP-proxy to the gateway's `/tools/invoke` endpoint using a gateway token
- **Shoggoth:** routes call Shoggoth's internal session spawn directly, using the plugin's **trusted in-process identity** — no HTTP call, no token
- **Same browser-facing API** — the SPA sends the same POST requests; only the server-side implementation changes

### Tool Surface

Eight direct tools replace the OpenClaw `NodeClient.executeCommand()` dispatch:

| Tool                    | Description                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `canvas.present`        | Show/present canvas content for a session  |
| `canvas.hide`           | Hide the canvas panel                      |
| `canvas.navigate`       | Navigate to a session/path or external URL |
| `canvas.eval`           | Execute JavaScript in the canvas iframe    |
| `canvas.snapshot`       | Capture canvas as base64 PNG               |
| `canvas.a2ui.push`      | Push A2UI surface commands (JSONL)         |
| `canvas.a2ui.pushJSONL` | Push raw JSONL A2UI payload                |
| `canvas.a2ui.reset`     | Clear A2UI surface state                   |

### Service Registration

```ts
ctx.registerService({
  id: "canvas",
  label: "Canvas",
  capabilities: ["canvas", "a2ui", "web"],
  expose: "both",
  port: canvasConfig.port,
  protocol: "http+ws",
  basePath: canvasConfig.basePath,
});
```

`expose: "both"` means the service is accessible via the `ServiceGateway` proxy (for browsers) and via direct tool handlers (for agents).

### Documentation

All Canvas project documentation is ported and updated:

- `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and all `docs/` files
- References to `openclaw` replaced with `shoggoth`
- URL schemes updated (`shoggoth://`, `shoggoth-fileprompt://`, `shoggoth-canvas://`)
- Environment variable config replaced with Shoggoth config section
- Node client and MCP sections removed
- Proxy route docs updated to describe in-process Shoggoth session spawn with trusted identity
- New `docs/tools/canvas.md` created in the main Shoggoth docs

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests:** Each tool handler, service registration, health probe, and shutdown hook
- **Proxy route tests:** `/api/agent` and `/api/file-spawn` adapted to mock Shoggoth session spawn instead of HTTP proxying to external gateway
- **Integration tests:** Plugin loads in the daemon, service appears in registry, tools are callable, SPA is accessible via gateway proxy
- **Existing tests:** Ported from the OpenClaw Canvas project, adapted for the plugin model (no mocks for gateway node client, external HTTP calls, or env vars)
- **Regression:** Full Shoggoth test suite must pass unchanged

## Considerations

- The `Gateway` class (WebSocket server) is shared between the plugin's HTTP server and direct tool handlers — it must be a singleton within the plugin process
- `canvas.snapshot` is async and uses a pending promise map with a 30s timeout — the direct tool handler must await this
- The Vue SPA client code is unchanged in behavior; only URL scheme strings and config reads are updated
- A2UI catalog packages are ported as separate packages within the monorepo
- The `ServiceGateway` handles WebSocket upgrade proxying — no special config needed for `/ws` and `/ws/a2ui`
- **No environment variables** — all configuration flows through `ctx.config.services?.canvas` with built-in defaults. This is cleaner than the OpenClaw approach of reading 7+ `OPENCLAW_CANVAS_*` env vars.
- **Trusted identity for auth** — the plugin doesn't need a token or secret because it runs in-process as a trusted extension. The daemon already trusts plugin code. This eliminates the operational burden of managing and rotating a gateway token.
- **Operator-initiated spawning is the core use case for the proxy routes** — an operator clicks an A2UI button in the canvas → SPA POSTs to `/api/agent` or `/api/file-spawn` → plugin spawns a subagent or prompts an existing session using its trusted identity

## Migration

- No database schema changes in the core Shoggoth database
- Canvas's own SQLite database (A2UI cache) is unaffected
- Config gains a `{ "package": "@shoggoth/service-canvas" }` entry in the `plugins` array
- Existing Canvas deployments must migrate from `OPENCLAW_CANVAS_*` environment variables to Shoggoth config entries under `services.canvas`
- No state migration needed — the A2UI SQLite cache is forward-compatible
