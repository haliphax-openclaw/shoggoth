# Web Services Plugin

## Summary

A first-class subsystem for declaring, managing, discovering, and communicating with HTTP/WebSocket services within Shoggoth. Enables agents to expose and consume web-based interfaces (Canvas, dashboards, APIs) through a unified lifecycle managed by procman.

## Motivation

Shoggoth currently has no concept of web services. Procman manages process lifecycles, but there's no layer above it that understands "this process serves HTTP on port X" or "agents should be able to call this service." As we port Canvas Web and anticipate future integrations (dashboards, webhook receivers, agent-facing APIs), we need a standard pattern for:

1. Declaring a web service and its contract (port, routes, protocol)
2. Letting procman manage its lifecycle with service-aware health checks
3. Allowing agents to discover and interact with services via tools
4. Optionally exposing services through a shared HTTP gateway with auth
5. Providing a communication bridge between agents and services (bidirectional)

Without this, each web integration becomes a bespoke wiring job. A plugin spec gives us a repeatable pattern and a clear extension point.

## Design

                                            (browsers, etc.)
```

### Key Components

**1. Service Declaration (config-driven)**

Extends the existing `processes[]` config with an optional `service` block. When present, the process is treated as a web service with additional lifecycle semantics.

```jsonc
{
  "processes": [
    {
      "id": "canvas-web",
      "label": "Canvas Web",
      "startPolicy": "boot",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/server/index.js"],
      "cwd": "/opt/shoggoth-canvas",
      "env": { "PORT": "3100" },
      "restartMode": "on-failure",
      "health": { "kind": "http", "target": "http://localhost:3100/health" },
      "service": {
        "port": 3100,
        "protocol": "http",
        "basePath": "/",
        "capabilities": ["canvas", "a2ui"],
        "expose": "gateway",
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

**2. Service Registry (runtime)**

A singleton that tracks healthy services and their metadata. Populated by procman lifecycle events (process started + health check passed → registered; process stopped → deregistered). Provides lookup by ID and by capability.

**3. HTTP Gateway (optional, daemon-managed)**

A lightweight reverse proxy that routes external requests to managed services. Runs as a procman-managed process itself (or an in-process HTTP listener). Provides:

- Path-based routing: `GET /svc/canvas-web/...` → `http://localhost:3100/...`
- Auth enforcement: validates Shoggoth-issued tokens before proxying
- CORS and rate limiting at the edge

The gateway is optional — services can also bind directly to host ports for development or single-service deployments.

**4. Agent ↔ Service Communication**
**4. Plugin Tool Registration**

Services provide their own tools rather than going through a generic invoke layer. The service plugin spec defines a hook for services to register tools with the daemon at startup:

- Service declares its tools in its manifest (`GET /manifest` → `tools[]`)
- On service registration (healthy), the daemon registers those tools into the builtin tool registry scoped to the service
- On service deregistration (stopped/failed), tools are removed
- Tools are thin proxies: the daemon handles auth token minting and HTTP dispatch; the service defines the tool schema and handles the request

This means Canvas provides `canvas.show`, `canvas.push`, `canvas.eval` etc. as first-class agent tools — not generic HTTP calls wrapped in a `service.invoke` envelope.

**5. Auth Token Minting**

The daemon mints short-lived HMAC-signed tokens that encode the requesting agent's identity. Services validate these tokens against a shared secret provided at startup via environment variable. This gives services a standard way to know which agent is calling them.

Token claims:

- `sub`: agent ID
- `scope`: service ID or `*`
- `iat` / `exp`: issued/expiry timestamps
- `session`: originating session URN (optional, for audit)

When a plugin tool proxies a request to its service, the daemon automatically attaches the token. The service validates it and uses the claims for identity and authorization decisions.

### Data Flow: Agent Uses a Service Tool

1. Agent calls `canvas.push { surface: "main", nodes: [...] }` (a tool registered by the Canvas service)
2. Tool handler (registered dynamically from manifest) resolves the Canvas service URL from the registry
3. Registry returns `{ url: "http://127.0.0.1:3100", healthy: true }`
4. Tool handler mints a short-lived token for the agent
5. Tool handler dispatches the request to the service with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
6. Canvas Web validates the token, processes the push, returns response
7. Tool handler returns the result to the agent

### Integration with Existing Systems

- **procman** — No changes to procman's core. The service registry listens to procman's `process-started` / `process-stopped` / `process-failed` events and maintains its own state.
- **Config schema** — `ProcessDeclaration` gains an optional `service` field. Backward compatible.
- **Tool registry** — Service tools are dynamically registered/deregistered based on service health. They coexist with builtin tools.
- **Shutdown** — Gateway drains connections before procman stops service processes. Registered as a separate drain phase.

### Service Contract (what services must implement)

A Shoggoth-managed web service must:

1. Read its port from an environment variable (configurable, default `PORT`)
2. Expose a health endpoint (path configurable in `health` config)
3. Accept `Authorization: Bearer <token>` headers and validate them using the shared secret provided in `SHOGGOTH_SERVICE_SECRET` env var
4. Optionally expose a `GET /manifest` endpoint describing its capabilities, routes, and WebSocket endpoints

The manifest endpoint is required for services that provide agent tools. It enables the daemon to dynamically register and describe tools without hardcoding knowledge of each service.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests** for service registry (register, deregister, lookup by ID, lookup by capability, health state transitions)
- **Unit tests** for token minting and validation
- **Integration tests** for the full flow: procman starts a mock HTTP service → registry picks it up → manifest fetched → tools registered → agent invokes tool → request proxied → response returned
- **Integration tests** for gateway proxying with auth enforcement
- **Integration tests** for tool lifecycle: service goes unhealthy → tools deregistered → service recovers → tools re-registered
- **Manual verification** with Canvas Web as the first real service

## Considerations

- **Port conflicts** — Services declare their ports in config. The registry should detect conflicts at config validation time, not at runtime.
- **Hot reload** — If a service's config changes (port, basePath), the gateway must update its routing table. This ties into Shoggoth's existing config hot-reload mechanism.
- **Multi-tenant isolation** — In a multi-agent deployment, services may need to scope data by agent. The auth token provides identity; the service is responsible for isolation. This plan does not prescribe how services partition data internally.
- **WebSocket lifecycle** — Long-lived WebSocket connections between agents and services need cleanup when sessions end. The `service.stream` tool should tie connection lifetime to the session or provide explicit close semantics.
- **Gateway vs. direct access** — For development, direct port access is simpler. The gateway adds latency but provides auth and a single entry point. Both modes should be supported; `expose: "gateway" | "direct" | "both"` in config.
- **Future: service-to-agent callbacks** — A service may want to push events to an agent (e.g., "user clicked button"). This plan covers agent→service. Service→agent (callbacks/webhooks) is deferred but the registry and auth infrastructure support it.
- **Static file serving** — Canvas Web serves a Vue SPA. The gateway could serve static assets directly (bypassing the service process) for performance, but this adds complexity. Deferred to a future optimization pass.

## Migration

No existing data or configuration is affected. The `service` field on `ProcessDeclaration` is optional and additive. Existing `processes[]` entries without a `service` block continue to work unchanged.
